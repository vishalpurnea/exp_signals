"""Correctness tests for strategies/base.py's Strategy/StrategyConfig contract.

Uses locally-defined dummy Strategy/StrategyConfig subclasses (never
registered via @register_strategy) so these tests exercise only the base
class's own machinery, independent of any concrete strategy's logic or the
shared strategy registry. Each test's docstring says what specific bug it
would catch if it failed.
