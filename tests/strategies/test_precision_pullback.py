"""Correctness tests for strategies/precision_pullback.py.

Unlike the other strategies in this package, this one is a genuine
multi-day state machine (_State: COUNTING_BLUE -> WAITING_FOR_RED ->
WAITING_FOR_RECOVERY -> WAITING_FOR_PULLBACK_MARK -> WAITING_FOR_CONTINUATION
-> back to COUNTING_BLUE after a BUY). Every generate_signals() test here
uses a small ema_period/blue_days_required (3/3 instead of the 50/90
defaults) and a day-by-day hand-traced price path so each state transition
can be pinned to an exact day -- every series below was walked through the
actual EWM math (span=3, adjust=False, alpha=0.5, invariant under a flat
run) before being hardcoded.

# Day-by-day design (ema_period=3, blue_days_required=3), hand-traced against
# the span=3/adjust=False EWM formula (alpha=0.5, invariant while flat):
#   days 0-4: flat at 100 -> EMA warms up at day 2 and stays at 100; days
#             2,3,4 are each a "blue" day (close >= EMA), reaching the
#             required 3-day streak at day 4 -> qualifies the uptrend.
#   day 5:    drops to 90 (EMA becomes 95) -- the first RED day (the
#             pullback). It is a bearish candle closing below the EMA, but no
#             BUY precedes it, so no SELL is emitted (exits are armed by entries).
#   day 6:    drops further to 88 (EMA 91.5) -- still red, tolerated,
#             no qualifying recovery candle yet.
#   day 7:    bull candle open=100/close=105, both strictly above the EMA
#             (98.25) -- the recovery candle. running_max_high starts at
#             this day's high (106).
#   day 8:    up day (close 110 > close 105) -- running_max_high updates to
#             its high (111).
#   day 9:    down day (close 108 < close 110) -- freezes mark = 111 (the
#             running max as of *before* today, i.e. day 8's high).
#   day 10:   bull candle closing at 112, above the mark (111) -- the BUY.
